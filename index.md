# This is Sampath!

I am post-doc research associate working with [Isobel Parkin](http://parkingenomics.github.io/) at the [Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Saskatoon](http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/scientific-collaboration-and-research-in-agriculture/agriculture-and-agri-food-research-centres-and-collections/saskatchewan/saskatoon-research-and-development-centre/?id=1180626618960). I have a broad knowledge and experience in plant molecular biology, genomics and genome evolution.<br>

I have worked on various aspects in multiple plant species (diploids and polyploids, monocots and dicots â€“ Brassica species, millets and rice) such as, <br>
	1. Good experience of genomics (Genome assembly, chloroplast assembly, Transposons, annotation) and molecular breeding techniques (MARS, MABC, GWAS, GS).<br>
	2. Experience analyzing NGS and long-read (Nanopore) for genome assembly [recent preprint] (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.932665v1), transcript quantitation, variant calling, gene expression analysis and methylome analysis.<br>	
	3. Experience in plant genomics research and computational methods for analysis Nanopore-seq, NGS, GWAS, linkage and QTL mapping, and phylogenetic data.<br>

Currently, I am focused on Genomics selection under MITACS elevate program to increase canola yield.

Looking for an opportunity in plant genomics filed to make a real difference and working on challenging problems that matters.
