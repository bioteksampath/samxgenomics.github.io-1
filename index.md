In my current role;
-	Management of multiple research program projects, including technical support staff and research activities, experimental design and infrastructure to support these projects and provide a range of high-quality genomics data and bioinformatics expertise to collaborating researchers.  <br>
-	Provide technical leadership for the development of short and long read sequencing of multiple genomes associated with PIP research projects, and the analysis of this data using multiple bioinformatics tools to generate genome assemblies, pan-genomes, transcriptomes and catalogues of genetic diversity (SNP and structural variation) and associate this with available phenotype data.  <br>
-	Responsible for recruitment, supervision and management of project staff (post-doctoral, graduate student and technical).  <br>
-	Supervision of the collection, analysis and synthesis of reporting data related to individual projects and the overall performance of PIP for submission to the GIFS Program Management portal and the preparation of internal GIFS reports and annual project reporting to funding agencies.  <br>
-	Organization and co-chairing regular research project meetings of PIP projects with representation from researchers of the partnering organizations.  <br>
-	Support and co-lead the development of manuscripts for publication and the identification of funding opportunities; provide technical review and support for developing co-funding for grant submissions.  <br>
-	In collaboration with GIFS Communication team co-lead the communication of program goals and outputs to external stakeholders (i.e., funding agencies, academic, government and industry) and other end-users.  <br>
-	Identify strategic alliance partners for the PIP and facilitate, develop and nurture long-term sustainable relationships.  <br>
