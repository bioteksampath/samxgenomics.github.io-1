# Sampath! Welcomes you!

I am post-doc researcher working with [Isobel Parkin](http://parkingenomics.github.io/) at the [Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Saskatoon](http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/scientific-collaboration-and-research-in-agriculture/agriculture-and-agri-food-research-centres-and-collections/saskatchewan/saskatoon-research-and-development-centre/?id=1180626618960). I have a broad knowledge and experience in plant molecular biology, genomics and genome evolution and I hold various experties in plant genomics and molecular breeding area, such as, <br>
	1. Good experience of genomics (Genome assembly, chloroplast assembly, Transposons, annotation) and molecular breeding techniques (MARS, MABC, GWAS, GS).<br>
	2. Experience analyzing NGS and long-read (Nanopore) for genome assembly [recent preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.932665v1), transcript quantitation, variant calling, gene expression analysis and methylome analysis.<br>	
	3. Experience in plant genomics research and computational methods for analysis Nanopore-seq, NGS, GWAS, linkage and QTL mapping, and phylogenetic data.<br>

Currently, I am focused on Genomics selection to increase canola yield under MITACS elevate program.
