# Sampath! Welcomes you!

I am a Researcher officer working with [Andrew sharpe](https://p2irc.usask.ca/profiles/theme-1/andrew-sharpe.php) and [Isobel Parkin](http://parkingenomics.github.io/) at the [Global Institute for Food Security, Saskatoon](https://www.gifs.ca/). I have a broad knowledge and experience in plant molecular biology, genomics and genome evolution and I hold various experties in plant genomics and molecular breeding area, such as, <br>
	1. Good experience of genomics (Genome assembly, chloroplast assembly, Transposons, annotation) and molecular breeding techniques (MARS, MABC, GWAS, GS).<br>
	2. Experience analyzing NGS and long-read (Nanopore) for genome assembly [recent publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-020-0735-y), transcript quantitation, variant calling, gene expression analysis and methylome analysis.<br>	
	3. Experience in plant genomics research and computational methods for analysis Nanopore-seq, NGS, GWAS, linkage and QTL mapping, and phylogenetic data.<br>

Currently, I am focused on long-read (Nanopore) based structural variant analysis in canola.
